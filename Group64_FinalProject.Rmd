### Background Information
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education and hosted at Kaggle. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.

### Why this Dataset?
This dataset consists of a number of numerical and catgorical predictors and is a very good candidate for applying concepts learned throughout the course. Another motivation factor is an ongoing Kaggle competition where we can benchmark predictions obtained by our model against the predictions made by thousands of other models.

### Data Loading
```{r}
housing_data = read.csv("housing_data.csv")
head(housing_data)
```


### Data Inspection
```{r}
summary(housing_data)
```


### Data Cleaning
```{r}
na_count = sapply(housing_data, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
na_count[na_count>100]

summary(housing_data[c("LotFrontage", "Alley", "FireplaceQu", "PoolQC", "Fence", "MiscFeature")])
#, FireplaceQu, PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature]
na_data = housing_data[c("LotFrontage", "Alley", "FireplaceQu", "PoolQC", "Fence", "MiscFeature")]
na_data
```

```{r}
myvars <- names(housing_data) %in% c("LotFrontage", "Alley", "FireplaceQu", "PoolQC", "Fence", "MiscFeature") 
newdata <- housing_data[!myvars]
newdata = newdata[complete.cases(newdata),]
newdata
```


### Train and Test Dataset
```{r}

```


### The Big Additive Model
```{r}
#model_1 = lm(SalePrice~PoolArea, housing_data)
model = lm(SalePrice~.,newdata)
model
```

### Variable Selection
```{r}
model = step(model, trace=0)

#model$xlevels[["Exterior1st"]] <- union(model$xlevels[["Exterior1st"]], levels(test_data$Exterior1st))
#model$xlevels[["ExterCond"]] <- union(model$xlevels[["ExterCond"]], levels(test_data$ExterCond))
#model$xlevels[["Foundation"]] <- union(model$xlevels[["Foundation"]], levels(test_data$Foundation))
#model$xlevels[["Heating"]] <- union(model$xlevels[["Heating"]], levels(test_data$Heating))
```

```{r}
